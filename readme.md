## About

_I made this app as a project in purpose to learn python. This is app that I built to generate random password, Also, I challenged myself and made that you can convert password to two given hash algorithm: SHA-256 and Argon2id. This project I was started with simple code, then wanted to make gui app and finished all of that with using tkinter gui framework._
